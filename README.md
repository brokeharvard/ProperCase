# ProperCase
 ProperCase determines the proper capitalization of a given word or phrase (e.g., "McDonald's") by:  (1) checking a 
 dictionary of proper nouns for the proper capitalization of the given word or phrase; and (2) solely if the given 
 word or phrase is not in the dictionary, reviewing the capitalization of the word or phrase in top Google search 
 results (in which case the proper capitalization of the word or phrase is added to the dictionary).
